This project is a combination of frontend and backend. In the backend I have used a data set of real estate and analysed it by diffrent machine learning algorithms to find the best fit algorithm. Later I combined it with frontend to make a user interface through . Now a user can select his/her requirements like no. of bedroom,bathroom, balcony,area etc easily through a webpage and get the predicted cost of the property.
